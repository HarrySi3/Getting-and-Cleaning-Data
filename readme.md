Script run_analysis.R

This R script performs the following steps:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Assumptions

This script assumes that you have already downloaded and unzipped the original Samsung data in a folder called _UCI HAR Dataset_. 

Running the script

In your R enviroment (in the same folder where the data files are), load the script:

```
source('run_analysis.R')
```

The end result will be a file called `tidy_dataset.txt'`.

Each row in the final, clean dataset contains _subject_, _activity_, and _measures_ for all required features (i.e., mean or standard deviation).
